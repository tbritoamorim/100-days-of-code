### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS and started researching about how to use form data.

**Thoughts:** CSS positioning is still a little time consuming but figuring out how to use the form is way more. It's the first time I attempt to use it.

### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Well, although there are still things to improve, the site first project is aliiiiiive. It's alive. Started learning php today to use in a form handling. 

**Thoughts:** It was awesome. I have never seen PHP before, had to download servers and learn to to use them and implement the PHP to the HTML. I guess it took more than 3 hours today, but I couldn't be happier.

### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Removed the form tags to enable Javascript to handle with the data. Rewrote Javascript and adapted HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Although PHP was a nice adventure, Javascript made way more sense to use. I honestly love it, but adding it to the the HTML and having events listeners was a little horrible. I was shocked when it finally worked, cause it took hours to that. But I couldn't be happier. Gotta try to deploy it tomorrow with GitHub.

### Day 5: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project, worked on the index.html and the css for the page.

**Thoughts:** I really hope that centering in css will get easier with time. I totally learned something about nested columns on bootstrap today. Worked for more than 3 hours and it just flew by.
