### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS and started researching about how to use form data.

**Thoughts:** CSS positioning is still a little time consuming but figuring out how to use the form is way more. It's the first time I attempt to use it.

### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Well, although there are still things to improve, the site first project is aliiiiiive. It's alive. Started learning php today to use in a form handling. 

**Thoughts:** It was awesome. I have never seen PHP before, had to download servers and learn to to use them and implement the PHP to the HTML. I guess it took more than 3 hours today, but I couldn't be happier.
