### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS and started researching about how to use form data.

**Thoughts:** CSS positioning is still a little time consuming but figuring out how to use the form is way more. It's the first time I attempt to use it.

### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Well, although there are still things to improve, the site first project is aliiiiiive. It's alive. Started learning php today to use in a form handling. 

**Thoughts:** It was awesome. I have never seen PHP before, had to download servers and learn to to use them and implement the PHP to the HTML. I guess it took more than 3 hours today, but I couldn't be happier.

### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Removed the form tags to enable Javascript to handle with the data. Rewrote Javascript and adapted HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Although PHP was a nice adventure, Javascript made way more sense to use. I honestly love it, but adding it to the the HTML and having events listeners was a little horrible. I was shocked when it finally worked, cause it took hours to that. But I couldn't be happier. Gotta try to deploy it tomorrow with GitHub.

### Day 5: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project, worked on the index.html and the css for the page.

**Thoughts:** I really hope that centering in css will get easier with time. I totally learned something about nested columns on bootstrap today. Worked for more than 3 hours and it just flew by.

### Day 6: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Had to change the svg on the page, started with jQuery.

**Thoughts:** After dealing with some problems on jQuery, started the animation just to realise the svg I had wasn't going to work for my purposes. Had to draw one and replace it, put the classes on its parts to animate again... At least I managed to put jQuery to work. Hope to have it done by tomorrow.

### Day 7: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot more of animations, added them to Javascript.

**Thoughts:** The animations took a considerable time today, there's two more left that I'm going to finish tomorrow. I was glad when I was able to center the buttons inside of the well. Little stuff, but satisfing.

### Day 8: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the animations, wraped-up Javascript and started to make it responsive.

**Thoughts:** I'm satisfied with the animations and how the page looks. It's simple, but I'm proud. Gonna fiz the little issues tomorrow.

### Day 9: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It's responsive now! I also made some changes in the design and fixed the issues. Added a logo and animated it on hover.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day. Tomorrow it's deploying day!!!

### Day 10: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I deploy the website!! Also finished the basic algorithms on fcc, so now I can start the new projects. I did the basic html and css for my random quote machine.

**Thoughts:** What a day! I did a lot. Gonna miss the time I'm putting in this when my vacation is over.

### Day 11: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started digging into JSON and a lot of my day was reading documentation and learning how to use an API. But I still managed to apply it to my page and add some things to the design. I hope to finish it by tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** What a day!(2). Second day in a row that I feel accomplished. I wanna do a lot of projects with APIs now to practice. Can't wait. Since yesterday I started using WakaTime to track my progress as well. It counted 6h9m today.

### Day 12: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my random quote machine. Yay! It's on githubPages (first link, if you want to check it).

**Thoughts:** Worked on making the animations the way I wanted, twitter API, random background image, css details, making a counter of quotes. I'm quite satisfied with the result. It's note responsive yet, but I'll work on that tomorrow. It looks good and it's by far the most professional thing I've ever done.

### Day 13: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my weather app, basic html, added APIs;

**Thoughts:** Adding the two APIs was a lot of work, I need to practice this waaaaay more, I also decided to start using Sass, so another thing that took me some time. I don't feel like I did much progress today cause I was stuck most of the time, but that's how it is. API, I'm gonna get you.

### Day 14: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add icons to be pulled depending on the weather, basic design.

**Thoughts:** It's been two weeks! It's been an awesome experience so far, I'm learning so much. Sometimes I just can't stop!

### Day 15: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Animated the icons and made background change to type of weather.

**Thoughts:** Spend most of the time today on Sass. It's rewarding, but still a challenge. Tomorrow I'm back to work, so I'll have less time, slower progress, but let's keep it going.

### Day 16: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still on the weather app, I'm getting satisfyied with the design, might deploy it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad I started using Sass. I did have less time and ended up taking 30 minutes off sleep, which I'll probably miss in a few hours. Besides that, this is basically the forth site I finish since I started this challenge and I'm loving every minute.

### Day 17: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started redoing my weather app...

**Thoughts:** Couldn't deploy it due to mixed context, which I only heard  about today. Both my APIs use http so it was being really hard to adapt it. I decided t start all over again. At least now I'm using git on the command line and it feels nice.

### Day 18: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started developing the design.

**Thoughts:** CSS positioning always playing tricks. I just hope it works we I start adding Javascript soon...

### Day 19: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have a lot of progress, still working on the css.

**Thoughts:** I really like Sass, I'm not fast yet but I will.
